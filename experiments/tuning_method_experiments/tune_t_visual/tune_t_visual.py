# plot H,V,T to see if optimal t is roughly half-period , identify optimal t on graph for easy inspection
# unit_e and find conservative epsilon
# logistic,mvn, neural network ,

# logistic different dataset

# nn different dataset

# use epsilon that gives high (>95percent) acceptance rate and reasonable ess and pass convergence diagnostics test (Rhat)

# use dual averaging for epsilon and gnuts to find list of (q,p) for each problem
