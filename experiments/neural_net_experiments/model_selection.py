# loo vs waic vs test set
# small data
# compare waic with testset error for different model structures (normal prior, gaussian_inv_gamma,horseshoe,rhorseshoe)
# for the hierarchical priors also test ard versions (like local scales for each unit, one global scale for the layer)
# experiment 2
# given long chain, plot the progression of waic
