# compare test error for fixed model (set to a reasonable number of hidden units) using same number of samples
# each sampler sees the same number of observed samples.
# gaussian inv gamma prior
# fair comparison : should use hmc and share epsilon and L
# unit_e
# use gnuts dual averaging to tune epsilon
