# fixed prior standard normal prior , normal(0,1/N) prior

# test regression benchmark problems

# test classfication benchmark problems

# use gnuts adapting epsilon and Cov

# care taken to use longer init_buffer in adapter

# get problem difficulty by using statistics sigma_max/sigma_min

# assess convergence

# get convergence dignostics Rhat, ess, bfmi-e , number of divergent transitions, percentage hit max tree depth

# lp statistics

# small data vs big data (not relative to model size)

# take 10/th for dataset
