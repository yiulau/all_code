# test nuts vs gibbs on regression toy problem

# adaptive tuning epsilon diag cov for gnuts
# adaptive tune epsilon unit_e for gibbs when sampling lower weights
# gaussian inverse gamma prior

# compare ess (min ess and ess for hyperparameter)

# use number of divergent transitions to detect problem

# for the weights use dual averaging and gnuts
